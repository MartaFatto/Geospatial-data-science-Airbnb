FLANDERS TODAY a flemish online newspaper has published an article about us and about Airbnb:
“In the last year we’ve had 60 or so guests staying with us at home,” says Fronk, who, with his partner Lieve, is one of the best-rated Flemish hosts on Airbnb, a hotel-like service for the digital age. “We have had guests from Brazil, the US, Canada, Iran, Japan, Bulgaria and more. Though no one from Africa has yet requested to stay.” 
Airbnb is an online marketplace for temporary accommodation across 33,000 cities in 192 countries. Trip planners can find spare rooms, flats, sofa-beds and even igloos and private islands. Some hosts are simply renting out a spare room for a couple of weeks a month to travellers to supplement their incomes or to fill the house when they themselves are away. 
Airbnb is in the vanguard of the so-called “sharing economy”, in which web services help private individuals monetise their possessions and share anything from school runs to electric drills. Flanders has more than 900 listings on the site. 
Connections 
Fronk and Lieve say that their guests have loved Antwerp and always have a good time. Yet if a number of their guests are visiting for tourism, many are in town for less conventional reasons. One was interviewing for a job at the opera house. Another was doing a course with world-famous contemporary artist Jan Fabre, while a third was studying with a leading dancer. A medievalist stayed for several weeks to learn Dutch for her research, while a Canadian rock band crashed when gigging down the road. 
Connecting with new people with different world views is one of the attractions, as is discovering a unexpected shared interest. “The other day I was having a bowl of soup with one of our guests, who had just arrived from the United States,” recalls Fronk. “To our surprise, we soon discovered that we were both working on essays on the same subject.” Fronk, who is a literary translator of Russian and a performer, and Lieve, an organist and soprano, say that in their year of hosting they have yet to have a bad experience. Some guests stay several weeks, some come back for a second or third visit. “But we make it clear on the website that we are vegetarians, that we do yoga and that this is a family house,” Fronk explains. This attracts people who are into the same things (and probably discourages those who want to spend their time exploring Antwerp’s party scene). 
Peer reviews 
Fronk and Lieve live in Borgerhout, a neighbourhood with a large immigrant population just east of the city’s Central Station, which is visible from their balcony. Borgerhout itself does not house many attractions and enjoys a reputation for being a rough sort of place. But guests have never had any problems, says Fronk. Indeed, he wistfully recalls a middle-aged American visitor looking out of the window at the district where Fronk grew up and declaring it a beautiful place. 
Importantly for guests, the area provides easy access by foot or bike to Antwerp’s main sites, including the zoo; elephants can be heard vaguely trumpeting from the flat’s balcony.

Airbnb is an online marketplace for temporary accommodation across 33,000 cities in 192 countries. Trip planners can find spare rooms, flats, sofa-beds and even igloos and private islands. Some hosts are simply renting out a spare room for a couple of weeks a month to travellers to supplement their incomes or to fill the house when they themselves are away. 
Airbnb is in the vanguard of the so-called “sharing economy”, in which web services help private individuals monetise their possessions and share anything from school runs to electric drills. Flanders has more than 900 listings on the site. 
Connections 
Fronk and Lieve say that their guests have loved Antwerp and always have a good time. Yet if a number of their guests are visiting for tourism, many are in town for less conventional reasons. One was interviewing for a job at the opera house. Another was doing a course with world-famous contemporary artist Jan Fabre, while a third was studying with a leading dancer. A medievalist stayed for several weeks to learn Dutch for her research, while a Canadian rock band crashed when gigging down the road. 
Connecting with new people with different world views is one of the attractions, as is discovering a unexpected shared interest. “The other day I was having a bowl of soup with one of our guests, who had just arrived from the United States,” recalls Fronk. “To our surprise, we soon discovered that we were both working on essays on the same subject.” Fronk, who is a literary translator of Russian and a performer, and Lieve, an organist and soprano, say that in their year of hosting they have yet to have a bad experience. Some guests stay several weeks, some come back for a second or third visit. “But we make it clear on the website that we are vegetarians, that we do yoga and that this is a family house,” Fronk explains. This attracts people who are into the same things (and probably discourages those who want to spend their time exploring Antwerp’s party scene). 
Peer reviews 
Fronk and Lieve live in Borgerhout, a neighbourhood with a large immigrant population just east of the city’s Central Station, which is visible from their balcony. Borgerhout itself does not house many attractions and enjoys a reputation for being a rough sort of place. But guests have never had any problems, says Fronk. Indeed, he wistfully recalls a middle-aged American visitor looking out of the window at the district where Fronk grew up and declaring it a beautiful place. 
Importantly for guests, the area provides easy access by foot or bike to Antwerp’s main sites, including the zoo; elephants can be heard vaguely trumpeting from the flat’s balcony.

My job allows me to choose my working hours, so I can make time for my guests on arrival, or at breakfast. It's also possible to get in with keybox/code. Wifi is available, as are city guide maps. I hope to see you soon, feel free to contact me if you have any questions.

Warm greetings,
Son:)

Hey daar,  
Ik ben Son, 'doorzomerde' fietster, van een trip naar Parijs tot een rondje wereld, en heb dan ook graag reizigersvolk over de vloer, om verhalen en ervaringen te delen bij het ontbijt. Mijn huis is gelegen op korte wandelafstand van het Centraal Station Antwerpen. Mijn job laten ons meestal toe om mijn werkuren te kiezen, dus kan ik tijd vrij maken voor mijn gasten, bij ontvangst en bij het ontbijt. Het is ook mogelijk om binnen te komen met sleutelkastje/code.
Als je vragen of opmerkingen hebt, aarzel dan niet om mij te contacteren.

Ik ben  29 jaar, werk parttime en studeer  taal- en letterkunde aan de Universiteit van Antwerpen. Ik hou erg  van het levendige en bruisende, dat elke stad in zich heeft en probeer daar zoveel mogelijk van te genieten:  de terrasjes, optredens in parken of festivals, shoppen,   theatervoorstellingen, musea, flaneren door de stad, noem maar op.  Vermits ik vrij sociaal ben en snel  contacten maak, past de AirBnB -formule  helemaal in mijn visie: een cosy plek verschaffen aan de reislustige gasten, hen informatie geven over mijn stad en enige interactie opbouwen zonder opdringerigheid. Eén punt hebben de gasten en ik gemeen: we reizen graag, doen dit graag op een niet al te conventionele manier en houden van interactie met de plaatselijke inwoner(s).  Zo ging ik naar San Francisco om bij een jeugdvriendin in te wonen, nam deel aan een intercultureel project in Mexico,  deelde het appartement van een inwoonster in  Berlijn, Valladolid, Barcelona en Wenen, enz.  Ik probeer me ook thuis op reis te voelen of zoals de Nederlandse schrijver Godfried Bomans, één mijn favoriete schrijvers, het stelde : ” De kunst van te leven is thuis te zijn alsof men op reis is "". Ik hoop dat ik mijn gasten een gevoel van 'thuis zijn'  tijdens hun reis kan geven en hoop jullie snel te mogen verwelkomen en ontmoeten in (Website hidden by Airbnb) kijk er alvast naar uit..

Tengo 29 años y estudio Lengua y Literatura en la Universidad de Amberes y trabajo a medio tiempo en la ciudad. Me encanta el ambiente animado de cada ciudad y trato de disfrutarlo lo más posible con paseos a conciertos en festivales o parques, a través de la moda y las compras, obras de teatro, museos o simplemente pasear por la ciudad. Como soy una persona muy social y que rápidamente hace contactos, la visión de Airbnb es lo mío. Ofrezco un espacio agradable para los viajeros con deseo de explorar, facilito información sobre mi ciudad y establezco algún tipo de interacción sin impertinencia. Viajar de una manera poco convencional e interactuar con la gente local, es algo que los clientes y yo tenemos en común. Después de haber viajado a la ciudad de San Francisco para vivir con una amiga de la infancia, participado en un proyecto intercultural en México, compartido el apartamento de un habitante de Berlín, Valladolid, Barcelona, Viena, y más lugar, hasta trato de hacer unas vacaciones estando en mi casa. Como dice uno de mis escritores Neerlandés favoritos, Godfried Bomans ""el arte de vivir es estar en casa cuando uno está viajando."" Espero darles a mis invitados una sensación de ""hogar"" durante su estancia y espero que pronto pueda darle la bienvenida en Amberes.

I love the lively atmosphere of every city and try to enjoy it as much as possible. Going from concerts at festivals or parks, fashion and shopping, theatre performances, museums or just strolling through the city. And since I'm very social and quick to make contacts, the vision of an AirBnB is right up my alley. Providing a cosy space for wanderlust travelers, handing information about my town and creating some interaction without obtrusiveness. So travelling  in an unconventional way and interacting with locals is something the guests and I have in common. After travelling to San Francisco to live with a childhood friend, participating on an intercultural project in Mexico, sharing the apartment of an inhabitant in Berlin, Valladolid, Barcelona, Vienna, etc I even try to make a holiday out of being at home. Or as one of my favorite Dutch writers, Godfriend Bomans,  would put it; ""The art of living is to be at home when one is travelling"". I hope to bring my guests a feeling of ""Home"" during their stay and hopefully soon I'll meet and welcome you in Antwerp, I'm looking forward to it.

Ik ben  29 jaar, werk parttime en studeer  taal- en letterkunde aan de Universiteit van Antwerpen. Ik hou erg  van het levendige en bruisende, dat elke stad in zich heeft en probeer daar zoveel mogelijk van te genieten:  de terrasjes, optredens in parken of festivals, shoppen,   theatervoorstellingen, musea, flaneren door de stad, noem maar op.  Vermits ik vrij sociaal ben en snel  contacten maak, past de AirBnB -formule  helemaal in mijn visie: een cosy plek verschaffen aan de reislustige gasten, hen informatie geven over mijn stad en enige interactie opbouwen zonder opdringerigheid. Eén punt hebben de gasten en ik gemeen: we reizen graag, doen dit graag op een niet al te conventionele manier en houden van interactie met de plaatselijke inwoner(s).  Zo ging ik naar San Francisco om bij een jeugdvriendin in te wonen, nam deel aan een intercultureel project in Mexico,  deelde het appartement van een inwoonster in  Berlijn, Valladolid, Barcelona en Wenen, enz.  Ik probeer me ook thuis op reis te voelen of zoals de Nederlandse schrijver Godfried Bomans, één mijn favoriete schrijvers, het stelde : ” De kunst van te leven is thuis te zijn alsof men op reis is "". Ik hoop dat ik mijn gasten een gevoel van 'thuis zijn'  tijdens hun reis kan geven en hoop jullie snel te mogen verwelkomen en ontmoeten in (Website hidden by Airbnb) kijk er alvast naar uit..

Tengo 29 años y estudio Lengua y Literatura en la Universidad de Amberes y trabajo a medio tiempo en la ciudad. Me encanta el ambiente animado de cada ciudad y trato de disfrutarlo lo más posible con paseos a conciertos en festivales o parques, a través de la moda y las compras, obras de teatro, museos o simplemente pasear por la ciudad. Como soy una persona muy social y que rápidamente hace contactos, la visión de Airbnb es lo mío. Ofrezco un espacio agradable para los viajeros con deseo de explorar, facilito información sobre mi ciudad y establezco algún tipo de interacción sin impertinencia. Viajar de una manera poco convencional e interactuar con la gente local, es algo que los clientes y yo tenemos en común. Después de haber viajado a la ciudad de San Francisco para vivir con una amiga de la infancia, participado en un proyecto intercultural en México, compartido el apartamento de un habitante de Berlín, Valladolid, Barcelona, Viena, y más lugar, hasta trato de hacer unas vacaciones estando en mi casa. Como dice uno de mis escritores Neerlandés favoritos, Godfried Bomans ""el arte de vivir es estar en casa cuando uno está viajando."" Espero darles a mis invitados una sensación de ""hogar"" durante su estancia y espero que pronto pueda darle la bienvenida en Amberes.

Aangezien ik meestal de organisator ben als we met vrienden op citytrip gaan, ben ik eveneens graag een goede host voor mijn gasten.
Daarom sta ik altijd klaar met suggesties om jullie verblijf extra aangenaam te maken.
Ik woon al meer dan 10 jaar in dezelfde buurt als het appartement, wat betekent dat ik snel in de buurt ben in geval van een probleempje, maar ook dat ik de buurt heel goed ken en voldoende tips kan geven wat betreft bezienswaardigheden en restaurantjes. 
Het appartement is ruim en heeft een grote woonkamer met hoog plafond, wat ervoor zorgt dat het gezellig vertoeven is als je met een groep vrienden of met het gezin een weekend samen wilt doorbrengen.
Het interieur is nogal eclectisch qua stijl, vintage gemixt met design klassiekers. Vooral geen zwart/wit, maar kleurrijk, en ook zo ingericht dat het lijkt alsof iemand er echt woont, geen steriele hotelkamer. Ik ben een liefhebber van films, fotografie en kunst, en dit valt eveneens als je het appartement betreedt. Litho's van Karel Appel en Dali worden afgewisseld met foto's van Helmut Newton en Herb Ritts. 
Als ik zelf op citytrip ga, vind ik naast de huiselijkheid van het appartement dat ik huur, de locatie erg belangrijk. Daarom dat ik voor het appartement op Vleminckveld gekozen heb, het ligt recht in het midden van alle belangrijke attracties/buurten.
Je kunt deze allemaal te voet bezoeken, het bruisende Zuid, het historisch centrum, het shopping gedeeltje,... 
Het ligt dus enorm centraal en terrasjes en restaurantjes liggen zeer nabij, maar toch is de straat erg rustig, dus van nachtlawaai is geen sprake. 
Niet te vergeten is de supermarkt die zich in hetzelfde gebouw bevindt, super handig als je last minute nog iets nodig hebt.
Kortom ik heb geprobeerd alle elementen waar ikzelf belang aan hecht als ik op citytrip ga, te bundelen in het appartement dat ik verhuur in mijn thuishaven Antwerpen.

Fronk (49 y.) and Aurora (18 y.) love talking, laughing and music.
Communication is always easy as we speak several languages
Fronk is crazy about Brazil, where he lived for 2 years
Lieve adores India and Aurora is mad about Greece.
We have a preference for natural, vegetarian food.
Lieve and Fronk  practice Yoga daily..
We and our neighbours live on pleasant terms with each other.
Tranquility is a must in our home and in the building.
Please ring our bell... N°116/14 (fifth floor)

FLANDERS TODAY a flemish online newspaper has published an article about us and about Airbnb:
“In the last year we’ve had 60 or so guests staying with us at home,” says Fronk, who, with his partner Lieve, is one of the best-rated Flemish hosts on Airbnb, a hotel-like service for the digital age. “We have had guests from Brazil, the US, Canada, Iran, Japan, Bulgaria and more. Though no one from Africa has yet requested to stay.” 
Airbnb is an online marketplace for temporary accommodation across 33,000 cities in 192 countries. Trip planners can find spare rooms, flats, sofa-beds and even igloos and private islands. Some hosts are simply renting out a spare room for a couple of weeks a month to travellers to supplement their incomes or to fill the house when they themselves are away. 
Airbnb is in the vanguard of the so-called “sharing economy”, in which web services help private individuals monetise their possessions and share anything from school runs to electric drills. Flanders has more than 900 listings on the site. 
Connections 
Fronk and Lieve say that their guests have loved Antwerp and always have a good time. Yet if a number of their guests are visiting for tourism, many are in town for less conventional reasons. One was interviewing for a job at the opera house. Another was doing a course with world-famous contemporary artist Jan Fabre, while a third was studying with a leading dancer. A medievalist stayed for several weeks to learn Dutch for her research, while a Canadian rock band crashed when gigging down the road. 
Connecting with new people with different world views is one of the attractions, as is discovering a unexpected shared interest. “The other day I was having a bowl of soup with one of our guests, who had just arrived from the United States,” recalls Fronk. “To our surprise, we soon discovered that we were both working on essays on the same subject.” Fronk, who is a literary translator of Russian and a performer, and Lieve, an organist and soprano, say that in their year of hosting they have yet to have a bad experience. Some guests stay several weeks, some come back for a second or third visit. “But we make it clear on the website that we are vegetarians, that we do yoga and that this is a family house,” Fronk explains. This attracts people who are into the same things (and probably discourages those who want to spend their time exploring Antwerp’s party scene). 
Peer reviews 
Fronk and Lieve live in Borgerhout, a neighbourhood with a large immigrant population just east of the city’s Central Station, which is visible from their balcony. Borgerhout itself does not house many attractions and enjoys a reputation for being a rough sort of place. But guests have never had any problems, says Fronk. Indeed, he wistfully recalls a middle-aged American visitor looking out of the window at the district where Fronk grew up and declaring it a beautiful place. 
Importantly for guests, the area provides easy access by foot or bike to Antwerp’s main sites, including the zoo; elephants can be heard vaguely trumpeting from the flat’s balcony.

In the 19th century, Napoleon Bonaparte had the first two docks excavated for an important naval base. This is followed by an intense flowering period in which several other docks will be excavated.<br />In the 20th century the port activities shift to the North. Most people move away and the « Eilandje » is a deserted area between port and city.<br /><br />At the end of the 20th century, one can see the potential of the abandoned docks, quays and warehouses. The city writes, together with the organization ""City on the River"" an international architectural competition and in the early 1990s the Spanish architect Manuel de Solà-Morales draws an initial plan for The Island. In 1997 René Daniel's works out concrete plans for the Old Docks, the Montevideo district and the Cadix district.

Hi everyone,
My name is Christel and this is my story:
I come from the countryside of Belgium. You know...like a small time-stood-still-village where everybody knows everybody :) ? Well, the only way to get out of there once in a while is by going to my favorite city in Belgium, Antwerp.

The City.
I like art, no I mean I LOVE art. Music, theatre, ballet, expositions, literature, performances,...are my sources of inspiration to be creative. I also love  Antwerp is both modern and authentic. It’s a city that moves. There are dozens of cultural activities every week. The food in the restaurants, even in the tiny bars are amazing. It’s ALL about exploring with all your senses. 

About the apartment.
My husband, my kids and I renovated this building a couple of years ago. I prefer to stay there once in a while, having some time for myself. That’s why we decided it to rent it on Airbnb. We’ve chosen for this neighborhood ‘cause it’s the most upcoming place in Antwerp. It’s on a foot walk from the centre and yet it’s different. It’s Antwerps most multicultural neigbourhood. Over 70 different nationalities! And they all have their own cultural traditions which are awesome to discover!

To my guests.
Enjoy your time in Antwerp, they say it's the city of diamonds. 
But for me it's the people who shine :)
Leave a note, a comment or better...a story before you leave. 
I love stories.

Als fervente reizigers hopen we nu ook zelf anderen te kunnen helpen bij het ontdekken van onze lievelingsstad: Antwerpen!!

Samen spreken we bovendien vijf verschillende talen, dus kom ons gerust aan een taalproef onderwerpen...

After 10 years of living in the city, our family life needed a calmer and greener setting, but we still enjoy visiting cities, going out for drinks and dinner, going to concerts and theater shows and going on holiday off course, who doesn't? :-) 
Whenever we go on holiday, we always like the personal contact and all the tips from local people, so that is why we really like the airbnb system. That is also the reason why we now decided to rent out our 'old' appartment in the city center, to be able to share that great spot & our favorite bars and restaurants with nice people from all around the world.

Hi everyone,
My name is Christel and this is my story:
I come from the countryside of Belgium. You know...like a small time-stood-still-village where everybody knows everybody :) ? Well, the only way to get out of there once in a while is by going to my favorite city in Belgium, Antwerp.

The City.
I like art, no I mean I LOVE art. Music, theatre, ballet, expositions, literature, performances,...are my sources of inspiration to be creative. I also love  Antwerp is both modern and authentic. It’s a city that moves. There are dozens of cultural activities every week. The food in the restaurants, even in the tiny bars are amazing. It’s ALL about exploring with all your senses. 

About the apartment.
My husband, my kids and I renovated this building a couple of years ago. I prefer to stay there once in a while, having some time for myself. That’s why we decided it to rent it on Airbnb. We’ve chosen for this neighborhood ‘cause it’s the most upcoming place in Antwerp. It’s on a foot walk from the centre and yet it’s different. It’s Antwerps most multicultural neigbourhood. Over 70 different nationalities! And they all have their own cultural traditions which are awesome to discover!

To my guests.
Enjoy your time in Antwerp, they say it's the city of diamonds. 
But for me it's the people who shine :)
Leave a note, a comment or better...a story before you leave. 
I love stories.

Het is een kleinschalig hotel/guesthouse/logies met 4 charmante kamers met eigen badkamer en op het gelijkvloers een gemoedelijke koffiebar & daytime café. De publieke opening van de koffiebar is voorzien voor dit voorjaar!

‘Mañana Mañana’ is ontstaan vanuit het idee dat we allen meer moeten leren genieten van het leven van vandaag. In de huidige maatschappij gaat alles heel snel. Soms té snel. Af en toe is het dus niet slecht om te leven volgens de Spaanse mentaliteit, en enkele taken uit te stellen naar morgen. Zo kan je ruimte maken om te genieten van kleine dingen: een me-time momentje met een lekkere koffie, een ontspannend boek lezen, een jog-momentje om je hoofd leeg te maken, een weekendje weg met je partner in een gezellig hotelletje ...

We moeten echt meer tijd maken voor onszelf, wat vertragen, genieten van het kleine geluk, stilstaan bij hetgeen waarmee we bezig zijn, ons realiseren dat we vandaag leven, dromen proberen waar te maken en beseffen dat er nog andere dingen in het leven zijn dan rushen, stressen en deadlines halen. 

Zo heb je ons verhaal al in een notendop. We werken nog volop aan onze website en (Hidden by Airbnb) page. Maar wil je ‘Mañana Mañana’ in real life al leren kennen, boek dan alvast een kamer & take a moment to enjoy the moment… ",N/A,N/A,22%,f,https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/43510b35-35df-4d0d-af97-75aa32beb0a2.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small,https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/43510b35-35df-4d0d-af97-75aa32beb0a2.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium,,1,1,"['email', 'phone', 'reviews', 'jumio', 'offline_government_id', 'selfie', 'government_id', 'identity_manual']",t,t,"Antwerpen, Vlaanderen, Belgium",Sint-Andries,,51.21352,4.39132,Private room,Private room,2,,1 private bath,1,1,"[""Shampoo"", ""Patio or balcony"", ""Heating"", ""Luggage dropoff allowed"", ""Essentials"", ""Wifi"", ""Laptop-friendly workspace"", ""Bed linens"", ""Smoke alarm"", ""Hair dryer"", ""Hangers"", ""Lock on bedroom door"", ""Fire extinguisher"", ""Hot water"", ""Coffee maker"", ""TV"", ""Private entrance""]",$108.00,1,1125,1,1,1125,1125,1.0,1125.0,,t,29,59,89,179,2020-10-26,8,3,0,2017-10-08,2019-12-01,100,10,10,10,10,10,10,,f,1,0,1,0,0.22

My name is An.
I am 37 years old and live in Antwerp, with my two kids and husband.
Living without being able to garden would not work for me. Growing my own vegetables, herbs and fruits is my healthy addiction. Cooking these fruit and veg another. When the Belgian weather doesn’t make a gardener happy and I have to stick indoors, you will find me reading endlessly. Mainly historical fiction novels, which I tend to spice with some scientific non-fiction.
I love to swim and run….and scan second-hand shops and flee markets. When I discover something lying in the streets or materials my neighbors or friend true out, I will confiscate them to turn them into something “NEW”. Maybe you can discover some of these lovely treasures when you visit my place.
I am looking forward meeting you.

What I really love about the city is that it has everything you need but its still cosy and small so you can do everything by foot or bike. 
I'm born to a dutch father and brazilian mom and like to learn new languages and learn new cultures. I'm fluent in English, Dutch and Portuguese  and can speak a bit of french, spanish and german. Its nice that I can practice these languages some more while hosting! 
One of my Biggest passions is music and I'm lucky to be able to work with it.

A makeup artist from the Netherlands who has been living in Antwerp for 20 years now. Antwerp is such a wonderful city to live and work, I’ll probably never leave.

Meanwhile, I opened a beautiful make up academy and shop right in the historic city center right underneath this beautiful completely renovated complex where I also live. 

So ladies, if you want to make Antwerp unsafe for a weekend, you can go downstairs for a beautiful make-up! ;) and guys! If you go with your girlfriend or wife... Surprise them with a nice make-over before you go out. You ‘d never score points so easily! Haha :)) 

We will always help you with tips for the best places to visit and eat in Antwerp and there is always a  little surprise waiting for you when you check in.

the rooms are warm and cozy .. some large, some smaller, but all very charming and completely renovated.

As a makeup artist, hygiene is incredibly important to me and the rooms will be dust free and anti allergic, bathrooms will always be clean and the bedding freshly washed.

I hope to meet you soon!

Hallo!, Tof dat je ons appartement leuk vindt :)
We hopen jullie dan ook snel te verwelkomen! Zelf zijn we zot van A! Oorspronkelijk zijn we van een andere Vlaamse stad, namelijk Leuven, maar we verloren ettelijke jaren geleden ons hart aan deze mooie Scheldestad. We houden van de veelzijdigheid van de stad, het water, linker-en rechteroever...
Antwerpen heeft de kenmerken van een stad maar voor ons toch de gezelligheid van een groot dorp. De cultuurmogelijkheden, café's, wereldkeuken, clubscene, winkels en koffiebars typeren de veelzijdigheid van de stad. Er is maw voor ieder wat wils. Zelf zijn we fervente muziekliefhebbers en proberen we op geregelde basis wat dj's te gaan ontdekken en wat festivals mee te pikken. We wandelen graag en daar hebben we gezelschap voor! Onze twee mopshonden Spike & Lola houden ons fit :) 
En natuurlijk pikken we graag op geregelde basis een restaurantje mee! Genieten van de kleine dingen ... dat is iets wat we de laatste jaren meer en meer doen en wat ons ook oprecht gelukkig maakt.

Hi everyone,
My name is Christel and this is my story:
I come from the countryside of Belgium. You know...like a small time-stood-still-village where everybody knows everybody :) ? Well, the only way to get out of there once in a while is by going to my favorite city in Belgium, Antwerp.

The City.
I like art, no I mean I LOVE art. Music, theatre, ballet, expositions, literature, performances,...are my sources of inspiration to be creative. I also love  Antwerp is both modern and authentic. It’s a city that moves. There are dozens of cultural activities every week. The food in the restaurants, even in the tiny bars are amazing. It’s ALL about exploring with all your senses. 

About the apartment.
My husband, my kids and I renovated this building a couple of years ago. I prefer to stay there once in a while, having some time for myself. That’s why we decided it to rent it on Airbnb. We’ve chosen for this neighborhood ‘cause it’s the most upcoming place in Antwerp. It’s on a foot walk from the centre and yet it’s different. It’s Antwerps most multicultural neigbourhood. Over 70 different nationalities! And they all have their own cultural traditions which are awesome to discover!

To my guests.
Enjoy your time in Antwerp, they say it's the city of diamonds. 
But for me it's the people who shine :)
Leave a note, a comment or better...a story before you leave. 
I love stories.

It has long been a powerful magnet for everyone from fashion moguls and club queens to art lovers and diamond dealers. In the mid-16th century it was one of Europe’s most important cities and home to baroque superstar painters like Pieter Paul Rubens. Despite many historical travails thereafter and severe WWII bombing, Antwerp retains an intriguing medieval heart with plenty of café-filled cobbled lanes, a riverside fortress and a truly impressive Cathedral. Today, however, Antwerp’s top drawcards are its vibrant fashion and entertainment scene, booming diamond businesses along with its startling architectural and cultural contrasts.",https://a0.muscache.com/pictures/8396015a-d1a3-49ae-9ff6-8c485802f1c0.jpg,165436938,https://www.airbnb.com/users/show/165436938,Elisabeth,2018-01-02,"Antwerp, Flanders, Belgium","Hello, my name is Elisabeth!

It has long been a powerful magnet for everyone from fashion moguls and club queens to art lovers and diamond dealers. In the mid-16th century it was one of Europe’s most important cities and home to baroque superstar painters like Pieter Paul Rubens. Despite many historical travails thereafter and severe WWII bombing, Antwerp retains an intriguing medieval heart with plenty of café-filled cobbled lanes, a riverside fortress and a truly impressive Cathedral. Today, however, Antwerp’s top drawcards are its vibrant fashion and entertainment scene, booming diamond businesses along with its startling architectural and cultural contrasts.",https://a0.muscache.com/pictures/04aebfb1-51a4-4c38-9b57-39c397d911e9.jpg,165436938,https://www.airbnb.com/users/show/165436938,Elisabeth,2018-01-02,"Antwerp, Flanders, Belgium","Hello, my name is Elisabeth!

FLANDERS TODAY a flemish online newspaper has published an article about us and about Airbnb:
“In the last year we’ve had 60 or so guests staying with us at home,” says Fronk, who, with his partner Lieve, is one of the best-rated Flemish hosts on Airbnb, a hotel-like service for the digital age. “We have had guests from Brazil, the US, Canada, Iran, Japan, Bulgaria and more. Though no one from Africa has yet requested to stay.” 
Airbnb is an online marketplace for temporary accommodation across 33,000 cities in 192 countries. Trip planners can find spare rooms, flats, sofa-beds and even igloos and private islands. Some hosts are simply renting out a spare room for a couple of weeks a month to travellers to supplement their incomes or to fill the house when they themselves are away. 
Airbnb is in the vanguard of the so-called “sharing economy”, in which web services help private individuals monetise their possessions and share anything from school runs to electric drills. Flanders has more than 900 listings on the site. 
Connections 
Fronk and Lieve say that their guests have loved Antwerp and always have a good time. Yet if a number of their guests are visiting for tourism, many are in town for less conventional reasons. One was interviewing for a job at the opera house. Another was doing a course with world-famous contemporary artist Jan Fabre, while a third was studying with a leading dancer. A medievalist stayed for several weeks to learn Dutch for her research, while a Canadian rock band crashed when gigging down the road. 
Connecting with new people with different world views is one of the attractions, as is discovering a unexpected shared interest. “The other day I was having a bowl of soup with one of our guests, who had just arrived from the United States,” recalls Fronk. “To our surprise, we soon discovered that we were both working on essays on the same subject.” Fronk, who is a literary translator of Russian and a performer, and Lieve, an organist and soprano, say that in their year of hosting they have yet to have a bad experience. Some guests stay several weeks, some come back for a second or third visit. “But we make it clear on the website that we are vegetarians, that we do yoga and that this is a family house,” Fronk explains. This attracts people who are into the same things (and probably discourages those who want to spend their time exploring Antwerp’s party scene). 
Peer reviews 
Fronk and Lieve live in Borgerhout, a neighbourhood with a large immigrant population just east of the city’s Central Station, which is visible from their balcony. Borgerhout itself does not house many attractions and enjoys a reputation for being a rough sort of place. But guests have never had any problems, says Fronk. Indeed, he wistfully recalls a middle-aged American visitor looking out of the window at the district where Fronk grew up and declaring it a beautiful place. 
Importantly for guests, the area provides easy access by foot or bike to Antwerp’s main sites, including the zoo; elephants can be heard vaguely trumpeting from the flat’s balcony.

We hopen jullie dan ook snel te verwelkomen! Zelf zijn we zot van A! Oorspronkelijk zijn we van een andere Vlaamse stad, namelijk Leuven, maar we verloren ettelijke jaren geleden ons hart aan deze mooie Scheldestad. We houden van de veelzijdigheid van de stad, het water, linker-en rechteroever...
Antwerpen heeft de kenmerken van een stad maar voor ons toch de gezelligheid van een groot dorp. De cultuurmogelijkheden, café's, wereldkeuken, clubscene, winkels en koffiebars typeren de veelzijdigheid van de stad. Er is maw voor ieder wat wils. Zelf zijn we fervente muziekliefhebbers en proberen we op geregelde basis wat dj's te gaan ontdekken en wat festivals mee te pikken. We wandelen graag en daar hebben we gezelschap voor! Onze twee mopshonden Spike & Lola houden ons fit :) 
En natuurlijk pikken we graag op geregelde basis een restaurantje mee! Genieten van de kleine dingen ... dat is iets wat we de laatste jaren meer en meer doen en wat ons ook oprecht gelukkig maakt.

For your clothing and other belongings sliders, shelves and a clothing rack is present. Since the guesthouse has 2 bathrooms to share, the room itself, as an extra, has its own washbasin and -yes- 2 bathrobes! The walls are nicely decorated with some fine (Belgian) art. You'll always be welcomed with some tasteful tea, coffee and water.<br />The rooms","Located on the eastside of Central Station you can find the area of BORGERHOUT, a place where I now live for more than 10 years and which I really really love. Sharing the positive vibe of the district, its locals and all their wonderful initiatives is why I started my guesthouse right here, in the heart of 'BOHO' as we call it. The neighborhood is a mix of many different cultures, marked by a large Arabic population, so if you like North African/ Middle-East snackbars and shops, TURNHOUTSE BAAN is your place. Once you turn into one of the many smaller streets you will feel a creative and young atmosphere.

I'm an outgoing & social globetrotter fond of culture in a very broad way (music, film, art, architecture...). My biggest passions are travelling and food: start a conversation about one or both and I can go on for hours ;)
I'm a professional travel and event agent, and in my spare time I'm an amateur chef. Couldn't guess, right!?

I've been Airbnb'ing for several years already, as a traveller but also as a host. Positive experiences are very important to me so I always try to make people feel at ease in my apartment. Since I shortly moved in with my boyfriend, I'm now renting the entire condo instead of only a room.

Motto: live your dreams, explore the world!

Looking forward to meeting you.",within a few hours,100%,94%,t,https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/5bafff62-ae85-44c1-a113-2118db73c936.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small,https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/5bafff62-ae85-44c1-a113-2118db73c936.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium,,1,1,"['email', 'phone', 'facebook', 'reviews', 'jumio', 'government_id', 'work_email']",t,t,"Antwerpen, Vlaanderen, Belgium",Deurne Zuid West,,51.21128,4.4623,Entire apartment,Entire home/apt,4,,1.5 baths,2,2,"[""Dishes and silverware"", ""Laptop-friendly workspace"", ""Bed linens"", ""Hair dryer"", ""First aid kit"", ""Room-darkening shades"", ""Smoke alarm"", ""Hot water"", ""Dryer"", ""Shampoo"", ""Washer"", ""Hangers"", ""Oven"", ""Coffee maker"", ""Refrigerator"", ""Dishwasher"", ""Patio or balcony"", ""Luggage dropoff allowed"", ""Wifi"", ""Long term stays allowed"", ""Lockbox"", ""Microwave"", ""TV"", ""Elevator"", ""Heating"", ""Essentials"", ""Shower gel"", ""Kitchen"", ""Iron"", ""Paid parking on premises"", ""Cooking basics"", ""Extra pillows and blankets""]",$65.00,2,1125,2,2,1125,1125,2.0,1125.0,,t,0,0,0,26,2020-10-26,1,1,0,2020-05-08,2020-05-08,100,10,10,10,10,10,10,,f,1,1,0,0,0.17

Fronk (49 y.) and Aurora (18 y.) love talking, laughing and music.
Communication is always easy as we speak several languages
Fronk is crazy about Brazil, where he lived for 2 years
Lieve adores India and Aurora is mad about Greece.
We have a preference for natural, vegetarian food.
Lieve and Fronk  practice Yoga daily..
We and our neighbours live on pleasant terms with each other.

FLANDERS TODAY a flemish online newspaper has published an article about us and about Airbnb:
“In the last year we’ve had 60 or so guests staying with us at home,” says Fronk, who, with his partner Lieve, is one of the best-rated Flemish hosts on Airbnb, a hotel-like service for the digital age. “We have had guests from Brazil, the US, Canada, Iran, Japan, Bulgaria and more. Though no one from Africa has yet requested to stay.” 
Airbnb is an online marketplace for temporary accommodation across 33,000 cities in 192 countries. Trip planners can find spare rooms, flats, sofa-beds and even igloos and private islands. Some hosts are simply renting out a spare room for a couple of weeks a month to travellers to supplement their incomes or to fill the house when they themselves are away. 
Airbnb is in the vanguard of the so-called “sharing economy”, in which web services help private individuals monetise their possessions and share anything from school runs to electric drills. Flanders has more than 900 listings on the site. 
Connections 
Fronk and Lieve say that their guests have loved Antwerp and always have a good time. Yet if a number of their guests are visiting for tourism, many are in town for less conventional reasons. One was interviewing for a job at the opera house. Another was doing a course with world-famous contemporary artist Jan Fabre, while a third was studying with a leading dancer. A medievalist stayed for several weeks to learn Dutch for her research, while a Canadian rock band crashed when gigging down the road. 
Connecting with new people with different world views is one of the attractions, as is discovering a unexpected shared interest. “The other day I was having a bowl of soup with one of our guests, who had just arrived from the United States,” recalls Fronk. “To our surprise, we soon discovered that we were both working on essays on the same subject.” Fronk, who is a literary translator of Russian and a performer, and Lieve, an organist and soprano, say that in their year of hosting they have yet to have a bad experience. Some guests stay several weeks, some come back for a second or third visit. “But we make it clear on the website that we are vegetarians, that we do yoga and that this is a family house,” Fronk explains. This attracts people who are into the same things (and probably discourages those who want to spend their time exploring Antwerp’s party scene). 
Peer reviews 
Fronk and Lieve live in Borgerhout, a neighbourhood with a large immigrant population just east of the city’s Central Station, which is visible from their balcony. Borgerhout itself does not house many attractions and enjoys a reputation for being a rough sort of place. But guests have never had any problems, says Fronk. Indeed, he wistfully recalls a middle-aged American visitor looking out of the window at the district where Fronk grew up and declaring it a beautiful place. 
Importantly for guests, the area provides easy access by foot or bike to Antwerp’s main sites, including the zoo; elephants can be heard vaguely trumpeting from the flat’s balcony.

I am Son! I enjoy traveling as much as most of our guests. Cycling is my passion, for short as well as long distances.
The Antwerp Central Train Station is a short walk from my house. 
With the Metro station and rental bike stand around the corner, you can get to the old center of Antwerp in minutes, even when it's raining (which does happen in Belgium, from time to time...)

My job allows me to choose my working hours, so I can make time for my guests on arrival, or at breakfast. It's also possible to get in with keybox/code. Wifi is available, as are city guide maps. I hope to see you soon, feel free to contact me if you have any questions.

Warm greetings,
Son:)

Hey daar,

Mijn job laten ons meestal toe om mijn werkuren te kiezen, dus kan ik tijd vrij maken voor mijn gasten, bij ontvangst en bij het ontbijt.

My name is Danijela, I have quite an international background since I have been living in several European cities over the years (Rome, Milan, Belgrade, Amsterdam). But in the end I settled again in my beatiful home town of Antwerp.

I made a career switch recently going from management consultant to small enterpreneur, which gives me more time to focus on my interests and hobbies such as interior design, art, music (I play piano !) and travel.

I am rather informal and easy going and like meeting new people from all over the world and that is basically why I decided to join this network.

I speak several languages such as English, French, Italian, Dutch, some Spanish and German. Looking forward to meeting you !

Fronk (49 y.) and Aurora (18 y.) love talking, laughing and music.
Communication is always easy as we speak several languages

FLANDERS TODAY a flemish online newspaper has published an article about us and about Airbnb:
“In the last year we’ve had 60 or so guests staying with us at home,” says Fronk, who, with his partner Lieve, is one of the best-rated Flemish hosts on Airbnb, a hotel-like service for the digital age. “We have had guests from Brazil, the US, Canada, Iran, Japan, Bulgaria and more. Though no one from Africa has yet requested to stay.” 
Airbnb is an online marketplace for temporary accommodation across 33,000 cities in 192 countries. Trip planners can find spare rooms, flats, sofa-beds and even igloos and private islands. Some hosts are simply renting out a spare room for a couple of weeks a month to travellers to supplement their incomes or to fill the house when they themselves are away. 
Airbnb is in the vanguard of the so-called “sharing economy”, in which web services help private individuals monetise their possessions and share anything from school runs to electric drills. Flanders has more than 900 listings on the site. 
Connections 
Fronk and Lieve say that their guests have loved Antwerp and always have a good time. Yet if a number of their guests are visiting for tourism, many are in town for less conventional reasons. One was interviewing for a job at the opera house. Another was doing a course with world-famous contemporary artist Jan Fabre, while a third was studying with a leading dancer. A medievalist stayed for several weeks to learn Dutch for her research, while a Canadian rock band crashed when gigging down the road. 
Connecting with new people with different world views is one of the attractions, as is discovering a unexpected shared interest. “The other day I was having a bowl of soup with one of our guests, who had just arrived from the United States,” recalls Fronk. “To our surprise, we soon discovered that we were both working on essays on the same subject.” Fronk, who is a literary translator of Russian and a performer, and Lieve, an organist and soprano, say that in their year of hosting they have yet to have a bad experience. Some guests stay several weeks, some come back for a second or third visit. “But we make it clear on the website that we are vegetarians, that we do yoga and that this is a family house,” Fronk explains. This attracts people who are into the same things (and probably discourages those who want to spend their time exploring Antwerp’s party scene). 
Peer reviews 
Fronk and Lieve live in Borgerhout, a neighbourhood with a large immigrant population just east of the city’s Central Station, which is visible from their balcony. Borgerhout itself does not house many attractions and enjoys a reputation for being a rough sort of place. But guests have never had any problems, says Fronk. Indeed, he wistfully recalls a middle-aged American visitor looking out of the window at the district where Fronk grew up and declaring it a beautiful place. 
Importantly for guests, the area provides easy access by foot or bike to Antwerp’s main sites, including the zoo; elephants can be heard vaguely trumpeting from the flat’s balcony.
